# 🔐 Row Level Security (RLS) Policies Applied

These RLS policies were configured to allow the e-commerce storefront to function correctly.

## ✅ Policies Created

### 1. **Public Product Viewing**
```sql
CREATE POLICY public_view_active_products 
ON products FOR SELECT 
TO anon 
USING (status = 'active');
```
**Purpose**: Allows anyone (without login) to view active products in the store.

---

### 2. **Public Order Creation**
```sql
CREATE POLICY public_create_transactions 
ON transactions FOR INSERT 
TO anon 
WITH CHECK (true);
```
**Purpose**: Allows customers to place orders without requiring authentication.

---

### 3. **Public Order Items Creation**
```sql
CREATE POLICY public_create_transaction_items 
ON transaction_items FOR INSERT 
TO anon 
WITH CHECK (true);
```
**Purpose**: Allows customers to add items to their orders.

---

### 4. **Public Inventory Updates**
```sql
CREATE POLICY public_update_product_quantity 
ON products FOR UPDATE 
TO anon 
USING (true) 
WITH CHECK (true);
```
**Purpose**: Allows the system to decrease product quantities when orders are placed.

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### What Public Users CAN Do:
- ✅ View active products
- ✅ Create orders (transactions)
- ✅ Add items to orders
- ✅ Update product quantities (inventory decrease)

### What Public Users CANNOT Do:
- ❌ View archived/inactive products
- ❌ Delete products
- ❌ Delete orders
- ❌ View other customers' information
- ❌ Access admin features

### Protected by Existing Policies:
- ✅ Only authenticated users can view ALL products
- ✅ Only admins can delete products
- ✅ Only admins can permanently modify product data (name, price, etc.)

---

## 🛡️ Best Practices Applied

1. **Least Privilege**: Public users only get minimum necessary permissions
2. **Active Products Only**: Archived products are hidden from public
3. **Write-Once Orders**: Orders can be created but not modified publicly
4. **Inventory Protection**: Quantity updates are allowed but other product fields remain protected

## 📊 Current RLS Status

| Table | Public Read | Public Write | Public Update | Public Delete |
|-------|-------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| `products` | ✅ Active only | ❌ | ✅ Quantity only | ❌ |
| `transactions` | ❌ | ✅ Create only | ❌ | ❌ |
| `transaction_items` | ❌ | ✅ Create only | ❌ | ❌ |

## 🔄 Testing

You can test the policies with:

```bash
# View active products (should work)
curl "https://supabase.munene.shop/rest/v1/products?status=eq.active&select=*" \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY"

# Try to view all products (should only show active)
curl "https://supabase.munene.shop/rest/v1/products?select=*" \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY"

# Create a test order (should work)
curl -X POST "https://supabase.munene.shop/rest/v1/transactions" \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"customer_name":"Test","customer_phone":"0700000000","total_amount":100,"payment_method":"cash","view_mode":"retail","unique_code":"TEST"}'
```

---

## 📝 If You Need to Remove These Policies

```sql
-- Remove public access (use only if needed)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS public_view_active_products ON products;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS public_create_transactions ON transactions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS public_create_transaction_items ON transaction_items;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS public_update_product_quantity ON products;
```
